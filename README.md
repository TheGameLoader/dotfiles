# dotfiles
Loader's Linux dot files (pls don't bully me)

Distro: Arch (btw)\
DE: SXWM <https://github.com/uint23/sxwm>\
X11

I also found a script that could animate my wallpapers
the link: https://github.com/elapse-d/foo-Wallpaper-Feh-Gif 
It works for now, even tho i don't use it that much.

note: I put the strtscrpt.sh (its the startup script btw) in /usr/local/bin directory. I didn't find the specific place for it in my wm so I put it there due to some redditor.
